# balanced-binary-search-tree

Hey everyone, ninth project here for the Odin Project! Today, we're implementing a balanced binary search tree from scratch. Gonna keep it short so as always, any media that is not my own will be linked here, please go show all the creators some love! With that said, thank you for viewing this repo and I hope you enjoyed the project!
